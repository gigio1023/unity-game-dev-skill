# Unity Research Sources

The local `.research/` directory is ignored by Git and is not part of the skill
payload. Checkouts live under `.research/build/` because the package validator
and skills CLI already exclude `build` directories from recursive discovery;
upstream `SKILL.md` files therefore cannot become installable entries.

## Local checkout

The following shallow clones were created on 2026-07-10:

| Directory | Source | Checked commit | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.research/build/UnityCsReference` | [UnityCsReference](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference) | `979bc204a0c6506d87595a02fc89452687ed820d` | Unity 6000.7.0a2 C# reference source; API/source inspection only |
| `.research/build/InputSystem` | [InputSystem](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem) | `e4920593b2fb89543390b9d4d1a7fabb88fc2af1` | Current development source and `Documentation~`; package reports 1.20.0 |
| `.research/build/Cinemachine` | [Cinemachine](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.cinemachine) | `cecef108f04547f216c5c81f866c9c8c8e2c8157` | Current development source and `Documentation~`; package reports 3.1.8-pre.1 |
| `.research/build/Graphics` | [Graphics](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics) | `a7e4c051d256a781ab362c64316b125a1e104694` | Sparse checkout of Core/URP/HDRP/Shader Graph/VFX docs; packages report 17.6.0 |
| `.research/build/Unity-Skills` | [Besty0728/Unity-Skills](https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills) | `f6f09e6bb001aaf0c16dc2309062edfd10d124b7` | Community upstream and legacy-content comparison only |

These are moving development branches, not compatibility guarantees for a
project. In particular, UnityCsReference HEAD is an alpha editor line and
Cinemachine HEAD is a pre-release package. Match the project's exact editor and
package versions before using an API.

## Recreate the checkout

Run from this repository root:

```bash
mkdir -p .research/build
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference.git .research/build/UnityCsReference
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem.git .research/build/InputSystem
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.cinemachine.git .research/build/Cinemachine
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics.git .research/build/Graphics
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none https://github.com/Besty0728/Unity-Skills.git .research/build/Unity-Skills
```

Then select only the Graphics documentation trees:

```bash
git -C .research/build/Graphics sparse-checkout set \
  Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core/Documentation~ \
  Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal/Documentation~ \
  Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition/Documentation~ \
  Packages/com.unity.shadergraph/Documentation~ \
  Packages/com.unity.visualeffectgraph/Documentation~
```

## Source priority

Use sources in this order:

1. the target project's `ProjectVersion.txt`, manifest, lock file, settings,
   package cache, local source, and existing code;
2. Unity Manual and package documentation for that exact released version;
3. a matching release tag/branch in the official package repository;
4. matching UnityCsReference source when public;
5. current development branches only to understand upcoming changes;
6. community repositories as comparison or discovery, never as authority.

Unity 6 uses LTS and Supported Update release lines. “Latest” is not a universal
upgrade instruction: choose the line appropriate to the project, then verify its
exact patch and package set. See Unity's
[release support policy](https://unity.com/releases/unity-6/support).

## Refresh

Because the clones are shallow and ignored, update them explicitly:

```bash
git -C .research/build/UnityCsReference pull --ff-only
git -C .research/build/InputSystem pull --ff-only
git -C .research/build/Cinemachine pull --ff-only
git -C .research/build/Graphics pull --ff-only
git -C .research/build/Unity-Skills pull --ff-only
```

After refreshing, record new commit IDs and dates here only when a new skill
audit actually relies on them.
